Project Description:
The IRCTC e-Ticketing System is a web-based application developed using Java technologies like JSP (JavaServer Pages) for the front-end and Hibernate for the back-end.
This system allows users to search for trains, book tickets, manage reservations, and view their booking history seamlessly.
By leveraging Hibernate, the project ensures efficient database interaction and management.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can register and create accounts, and then log in securely to access the system's functionalities.

Train Search and Booking: Users can search for trains based on various criteria such as source, destination, date, and class. Once a suitable train is found, they can book tickets for their desired journey.

Seat Availability Check: The system should provide real-time information about seat availability in different classes of trains, allowing users to make informed booking decisions.

Ticket Reservation and Cancellation: Users can reserve tickets for their chosen journey and cancel reservations if needed. The system should handle refunds and cancellations according to the IRCTC policies.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integration with a secure payment gateway allows users to make online payments for their bookings. It ensures the security of transactions and provides a smooth payment experience.

Booking History: Users can view their past bookings, including details such as journey dates, train information, class, and status.

Email/SMS Notifications: Automated notifications should be sent to users upon successful booking, ticket confirmation, or cancellation, keeping them informed about their travel status.

Technologies Used:

Front-End: JavaServer Pages (JSP), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
Back-End: Java, Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
Database: MySQL supported by Hibernate
Web Server: Apache Tomcat

Database Design: Design the database schema to store user information, train details, reservations, and transaction history efficiently.

ORM Mapping: Use Hibernate to map Java objects to database tables, allowing seamless interaction with the database.

User Interface Development: Design and develop user-friendly web pages using JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience.

Backend Development: Implement the business logic and functionalities using Java, ensuring proper validation and error handling at every step.

Integration: Integrate the application with a secure payment gateway for online transactions, and configure email/SMS services for automated notifications.

Testing: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system is robust, secure, and free from bugs. Test various scenarios including booking, cancellation, and payment processes.

Deployment: Deploy the application on a web server such as Apache Tomcat, ensuring proper configuration and security measures.

Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation including user manuals, system architecture, and database schema for future reference and maintenance.

Project Extensions:

Seat Selection: Allow users to select their preferred seats while booking tickets, if applicable.
Mobile App: Develop a mobile application version of the system for users to book tickets on the go.
Integration with Travel APIs: Integrate with travel APIs to provide additional features such as hotel bookings, cab services, or tourist attractions information.
By following this project description, you can develop a robust IRCTC e-Ticketing System using JSP and Hibernate, providing users with a seamless and efficient way to book train tickets online
