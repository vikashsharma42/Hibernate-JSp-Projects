				are issued on 1/3rd of the total basic fares and normal cancellation
				charge is applicable in these tickets also. Therefore in many cases
				ticket value on PTOs is less than the cancellation charges therefore
				passengers may or may not cancel the tickets therefore cancellation
				across IRCTC website may be allowed in the case of PTOs also.</p>
